sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root /

sudo: Runs the command with superuser (root) privileges. This allows the command to delete files that a regular user would not have permission to delete.
rm: The remove command, used to delete files and directories.
-R (or -r): Recursive option, meaning it will delete directories and their contents recursively.
-F (or -f): Force option, meaning it will ignore nonexistent files and never prompt for confirmation.
--no-preserve-root: This option tells the command to not treat the root directory (/) in any special way. Normally, rm -rf / is blocked to prevent accidental deletion of the root filesystem.
/: The root directory, meaning the command is targeting the entire filesystem.
